# Assignment

The assignment has been devised with manual and automation testers in mind in order to assess your testing knowledge, attention to details and how you architecture the code.

Please carefully read what you need to do and what not to do. The assignment consists of two parts, backend automation and frontend automation.

## Frontend and Backend tasks

- [ ] Perform some Exploratory Testing sessions against the application to familiarize with it and report any bugs or mismatching behavior between the app and its specifications. You don't need to report every issue you find, and neither browser nor mobile compatibility issues. Please only report the ones you find most important, but at most 5 issues;
- [ ] Update the README.md file and explain how the tests can be ran locally;

## Frontend only tasks

- [ ] Cover 2 [requirements](docs/requirements.md) from the specifications with **End-to-End tests**. Choose the ones you find most important. Pick a testing framework you feel most comfortable with;

## Backend only tasks

- [ ] Cover 2 [requirements](docs/requirements.md) from the specifications with **API tests**. Choose the ones you find most important. Pick a testing framework you feel most comfortable with;
